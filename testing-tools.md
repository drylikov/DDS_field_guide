As described in the section on continuous deployment servers, running automated tests on each deploy or commit is an important way to ensure software quality.

The following table lists testing tools you're likely to encounter:

* [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/).  "CasperJS is an open source navigation scripting and testing utility written in Javascript for the PhantomJS WebKit headless browser and SlimerJS (Gecko).
